  type: text
  contents: |
    <b>Yuichi HIROI</b> is a researcher focusing on Augmented Reality (AR), near-eye display technologies, vision augmentation, and personalized visual experiences. His background as <a href='https://lamer-e.tv/'> a freelance motion graphics designer </a> has driven his passion for creating unprecedented visual experiences that transcend conventional display boundaries. <br><br>

    His research began with bridging the gap between intended and perceived visual expression, leading to occlusion-capable Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays (OST-HMDs) that enable precise modulation of real-world light for more natural AR experiences. <br><br>

    Understanding that individual differences in visual perception affect user experience, he developed an interest in personalized vision augmentation, integrating direct eye measurements with HMDs and adaptive systems that cater to individual visual preferences. <br><br>

    Currently, Yuichi is a Senior Research Scientist at <a href='https://lab.cluster.mu/en/'>Cluster Metaverse Lab</a> and a visiting researcher at <a href='https://lab.rekimoto.org/'>Jun Rekimoto Lab</a>, the University of Tokyo. His mission is to bridge the ideal and real worlds through VR/AR technologies, enhancing cognitive experiences by integrating cyber and physical spaces, with a focus on visual perception.
